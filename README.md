# The Wall

2D platformer created for HackYeah Game Jam in 2020. The main challenge to overcome was to implement a climbing mechanic, where the hands of the character are to be controlled independently, while also making it feel natural and keeping the body under the influence of gravity.

The next problem was keeping the body in-between of the hands while in the air. It took some maths to implement, but in the end, I was successful.

There is also the implementation of circular gravity, but it was pretty easy to do.
